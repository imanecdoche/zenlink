"""Consented driver switches between Apple mode and USB Direct.

The app process itself never writes driver state. A change runs only when
the user pressed a button in Settings > Connection & Drivers and confirmed
it; then `tools/usb_filter.ps1` runs elevated through UAC (Windows asks the
user), backs up the device's driver state, applies the change, verifies the
device restarted, and rolls back on failure.
