## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🤖 Android (new in v2.5)** | Android 5.0+ over USB, or Wi-Fi (one click from a USB connection, or Android 11+ wireless debugging with a pairing code). Picture, sound (Android 11+), mouse/keyboard control, clipboard, real device names, per-device settings, video profiles and Smart Encoder Detection (H.264 by default; H.265 only when the phone and Windows both decode it, with automatic fallback). Uses Google's official `adb` and the official scrcpy server, both bundled. |
| **🔌 Two Apple connection modes** | Choose before anything connects: **Apple Driver** (Apple's own driver, full control) or **ZenLink Studio** (for live streaming, like TikTok LIVE Studio). Each offers **Kabel** or **Nirkabel (Wi-Fi)**. "Remember my choice" skips the question next time. |
| **📡 ZenLink Studio over Wi-Fi (AirPlay)** | ZenLink is an AirPlay receiver: on the iPhone/iPad open **Control Center → Screen Mirroring → ZenLinkStudioNext**. No driver, no cable. The device's own stream is passed through untouched (HEVC or H.264, up to its native resolution); the how-to is shown on screen. |
| **🎥 ZenLink Studio over the cable** | QuickTime capture over USB in H.264 at the device's full native resolution and high bitrate (measured 2360×1640 on iPad 11th gen, 12–30 Mbps, up to ~56 fps). Picture and sound only. |
| **📶 Apple Driver over Wi-Fi** | Plug the device in once in Apple mode and ZenLink sets up Wi-Fi by itself; afterwards choose **Nirkabel**. ZenLink finds the device on the network itself, even where Windows gets no Bonjour replies. |
| **📊 Live stats** | Measured decode and display FPS next to the device name (switchable in Settings). |
| **⚡ Native window (Rust)** | Media Foundation hardware decoding (H.264 / HEVC) into a Direct3D 11 swap chain, one frame per refresh, Liquid Glass UI (Slint). No WebView2, no Visual C++ runtime needed. |
| **🎬 OBS ready** | Game Capture of the ZenLink window stays smooth and survives rotation (Settings › Record / stream in OBS). |
| **🔊 Synced sound** | Native WASAPI output (~22 ms) with an adaptive buffer and lip sync, so picture and sound arrive together. |
| **🖱️ Touch, keyboard & buttons** | Mouse as touch, PC keyboard typing, scrolling, Home / Recent Apps / Notifications / Control Center or Quick Settings, hardware buttons — follows rotation. |
| **📋 OCR copy & paste** | `Alt+C` copies the text on the device screen to the PC (Windows OCR, stitches scrolled pages). Paste the PC clipboard: `Alt+V` (Apple), `Ctrl+V` (Android). |
| **🌑 Stealth dim, wake & lock** | `Alt+D` dims the device to 0% while the picture stays bright; `Alt+U` wakes and types your passcode (DPAPI-encrypted); `Alt+L` locks. |
| **🛠️ Safe driver manager** | Install / restore drivers only after you confirm, with UAC, a backup and automatic rollback. Never stacks a libusb0 filter on Apple's driver. |
| **🇮🇩 / 🇬🇧 Bilingual UI** | Bahasa Indonesia by default, English with one click. Liquid Glass Dark by default; Light and System too. |

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

The same list is in **Settings › Keyboard shortcuts**. Click the picture first so the keys go to ZenLink; while the keyboard types to the device, plain keys go to the device and the Alt / Ctrl shortcuts stay with ZenLink.

| Shortcut | Action | Platform |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **`Space`** · **`M`** | Start / stop mirroring · sound on the PC on / off | both |
| **`F11`** · **`Esc`** · **`Ctrl + ,`** | Full screen · leave full screen · Settings | both |
| **`Alt + H`** | Rotate the view (Auto, 90°, 180°, 270°, 0°) | both |
| **`Alt + ←`** | Back | both |
| **`Alt + C`** · **`Alt + R`** | Copy the text on the screen to the PC (OCR) · clear the copied-text history | both |
| **`Alt + L`** | Lock (Android: power button) | both |
| **`Alt + U`** · **`Alt + D`** · **`Alt + V`** | Wake & unlock (saved passcode) · stealth dim · type the PC clipboard | Apple Driver |
| **`Ctrl + K`** · **`Ctrl + C / X / V / A / Z`** | On-screen keyboard · copy, cut, paste, select all, undo in iOS | Apple Driver |
| **`Ctrl + V`** · **`Ctrl + C / X / A / Z`** | Paste the PC clipboard · copy, cut, select all, undo on the phone | Android |
| **`Alt + N`** · **`Alt + Q`** · **`Alt + S`** | Notifications · Quick Settings · Recent Apps | Android |
| **`Alt + ↑ / ↓`** | Phone volume up / down | Android |

## 📦 Quick Start

### 📋 Requirements (Persyaratan)

- **Windows 10 (1809+) or Windows 11, 64-bit.** No WebView2 and no Visual C++ runtime needed. Windows "N" editions need Microsoft's free Media Feature Pack (ZenLink tells you and opens the page).
- **Android:** Android 5.0+ with **USB debugging** on (Settings › About phone › tap Build number 7×, then Developer options › USB debugging), a data cable, and **Allow** on the phone. Sound needs Android 11+. ZenLink brings its own `adb`; some phones (for example Samsung) need the maker's USB driver, which Windows Update usually installs.
- **iPhone / iPad: Apple Devices** (Microsoft Store) or iTunes, for Apple's USB driver and Apple Mobile Device Service.
- **Apple Driver mode** needs **iOS 17 or newer** with **Developer Mode** on: connect the cable, tap **Trust This Computer**, then **Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Mode → On** and restart. *(If the toggle is missing, opening a screen-mirroring tool once — e.g. 3uTools → Realtime Screen — makes it appear.)* On iOS 17–26 it runs **Hybrid Control** (see the matrix below).
- **ZenLink Studio** works without Developer Mode (cable or AirPlay). AirPlay needs the PC and the device on the same network; the installer (or the first run of `Start ZenLink.bat`) offers to allow ZenLink through Windows Firewall.

### 📊 iOS compatibility matrix

| iOS | Apple Driver mode | Picture | Control (touch, keyboard, buttons) | Tested on a real device |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **27 and newer** | **Native Control** | CoreDevice DisplayService (HEVC, cable or Wi-Fi) | CoreDevice HID | ✅ iPad (11th gen), iOS 27.0.1 |
| **17 – 26** | **Hybrid Control** *(Experimental)* | AirPlay to ZenLink (same Wi-Fi) | CoreDevice HID over the Apple driver (cable, or Wi-Fi after setup) | ⚠️ Not yet: simulated tests only |
| **16 and older** | Unsupported | Use ZenLink Studio | — | — |
| **Any (ZenLink Studio)** | — | QuickTime capture over libusb0 (cable) or AirPlay (Wi-Fi) | Mirroring only | ✅ Studio cable and AirPlay |

**How Hybrid Control works.** Apple's screen service only sends frames from iOS 27, but older iOS still accepts the stream request, and the CoreDevice HID services only deliver touches while such a stream is open. Hybrid opens that stream just to hold the input path open (its data is discarded), shows the picture from AirPlay instead, and maps touches through the device's orientation. Both paths run at once: AirPlay uses the network, control uses Apple's own USB driver; libusb0 is never involved. ZenLink checks the device's own service list before it claims control; if control can't be opened (for example Developer Mode is off), the picture keeps running and the app shows **Mirroring Only** with the reason.

**Not available on any version:** forcing the device to rotate (ZenLink follows the device's orientation instead) and Bluetooth HID control from Windows (Windows doesn't let apps act as a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse).

### Option 1A: Installer (Recommended)
1. Download **`ZenLink-vX.Y.Z-Setup.exe`** from [**Releases**](../../releases/latest).
2. Run it and follow the steps (Bahasa Indonesia or English). ZenLink appears in the Start Menu and, if you want, on the Desktop.
3. Open **ZenLink**, choose **iPhone / iPad** or **Android Smartphone / Tablet**, plug in your device and press **Mulai / Start**.

### Option 1B: Portable (one .exe, no installation, no Python)
1. Download **`ZenLink-vX.Y.Z-Portable.exe`** from [**Releases**](../../releases/latest) and put it anywhere.
2. Double-click it. The first start takes a few seconds (it unpacks the Apple backend and `adb`); data is kept in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ZenLink-Next`.

### Option 2: Run from Source
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/zenvyzenshiro/zenlink.git
cd zenlink
.\"Start ZenLink.bat"
```
The first run sets everything up: it installs Python 3.13 with winget if needed, creates the environment and installs `requirements.txt`, offers Apple Devices (for Apple Driver mode) and the firewall permission for AirPlay. For Android from source, set `ANDROID_HOME` to an Android SDK with platform-tools (the release packages bundle `adb`). Later runs open straight away. **`run.bat`** starts ZenLink with a visible console log.

Tests: `.venv\Scripts\python -m unittest discover -s tests` (no device needed; `tests\airplay_sim.py` simulates an iPhone mirroring over AirPlay).

To build the release files yourself: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_portable_release.ps1 -PlatformTools <Android SDK>\platform-tools` (Rust, PyInstaller, Inno Setup 6 for the installer).

## 🔌 Connection Modes

| | **Apple Driver** (Standard) | **ZenLink Studio · Kabel** | **ZenLink Studio · Wi-Fi (AirPlay)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Driver | Apple's own, nothing to install | libusb0 as the device's driver (installed by ZenLink after you confirm) | None |
| Video | HEVC, about 4–6 Mbps (device limit) | H.264 at native resolution, 12–30 Mbps, up to ~56 fps | The device's own HEVC / H.264, up to native resolution |
| Control | Touch, keyboard, gestures, buttons | Picture and sound only | Picture and sound only |
| Wi-Fi | Yes (set up automatically once over the cable) | — | Yes (Control Center → Screen Mirroring) |
| Apple apps (iTunes, Apple Devices) | Keep working | Can't see the device until you restore Apple's driver | Keep working |

Switch any time in **Settings → Connection & Drivers**. Changing the driver asks for administrator permission, saves a backup and rolls back on failure; unplug and reconnect the cable afterwards.

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

```
iPhone / iPad ─ Apple Driver (RemoteXPC / RSD tunnel) ─┐
              ─ Studio: QuickTime over libusb0, AirPlay ┼─ Apple backend (Python, headless, 127.0.0.1)

Android ─ adb (Google) + scrcpy server ─────────────────┼─ ZenLink.exe (Rust)
                                                        │   • Slint UI, Liquid Glass
                                                        │   • Media Foundation decode → Direct3D 11
                                                        │   • WASAPI sound, OBS-friendly frame pacing
```

1. **ZenLink.exe (Rust)**: window, settings, hardware decoding, rendering, Android client (ADB host protocol + scrcpy protocol), Android sound.
2. **Apple backend**: `pymobiledevice3` for Apple Driver mode (CoreDevice tunnel and DisplayService stream), the QuickTime USB protocol for ZenLink Studio over the cable, an AirPlay receiver for Studio over Wi-Fi. It runs headless on 127.0.0.1 and exits with the window.
3. **Android**: ZenLink pushes the official scrcpy server (v5.0.1) to the phone and reads its video, audio and control sockets through `adb`. Nothing is installed on the phone; the server is removed when the session ends.
4. **Local only**: video, sound, OCR and keystrokes never leave your PC. No telemetry.

## 🔒 Privacy & Clean Uninstall

- The passcode for `Alt+U` is encrypted with Windows DPAPI for your account only; remove it any time in Settings.
- **Installer version**: uninstall from **Windows Settings → Apps**.
- **Portable exe**: delete the `.exe` and the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ZenLink-Next` folder.
- **Source**: run **`Uninstall-ZenLink.bat`** — it closes ZenLink, deletes its settings, passcode and logs, removes the shortcuts and can delete the folder.
- If you used ZenLink Studio over the cable, press **Restore Apple driver** in Settings first so Apple apps see the device again.
